### Causal Inference Tutorials

Currently, I am offering regular tutorials ("Ãœbungen") in each of the three Political Science modules, with a focus on experiments and causal inference.

These courses will teach students how to analyze questions from their subfiled of interest through the application of causal inference methods. 

We will begin by asking what it means for X to cause Y using the framework of potential outcomes. We will then look at some of the most popular research designs in causal analysis including experiments, regression discontinuity designs, difference-in-differences / two-way fixed effects, and instrumental variables.

Students will learn to apply these methods to real data in R.

The overarching goal is to provide students with the foundation to perform their own analyses (e.g. for their BA theses) by transferring the acquired skills to their research interests.

You may find the link to each of the tutorials here:

### BA Thesis Colloquium in International Relations

This course involves support for writing a BA thesis in political science. 

Students will need to design and carry a research strategy that includes (i) identifying an original contribution to a body of literature, (ii) finding or generating appropriate data, and (iii) conducting a rigorous data analysis. 

This colloquium is designed to help students progress along each of these steps by providing periodic feedback from the instructor.
