I am Interim Professor ("Vertretungsprofessor") of [Evidence-based Political Research](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/zhang/) at the University of Mannheim, where I also head the Emmy-Noether research group Making Diversity Work at the [Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)](mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en). My work spans both Political Science and Sociology, with a focus on the study of group relations, language and identity, social norms, and civic behavior. Major applications include research on immigration, ethnic diversity, and state- and nation-building.

My work has been published in the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Politics*, the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*, the *American Journal of Sociology*, and the *European Sociological Review*, amongst other outlets.

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Stanford University, a J.D. from Stanford Law School, and a double B.A. in Economics and Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley. I have held prior positions at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and the European University Institute.
