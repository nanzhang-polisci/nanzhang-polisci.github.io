    "text": "I am Interim Professor (“Vertretungsprofessor”) of Evidence-based Political Research at the University of Mannheim, where I also head the Emmy-Noether research group Making Diversity Work at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). My work spans both Political Science and Sociology, with a focus on the study of group relations, language and identity, social norms, and civic behavior. Major applications include research on immigration, ethnic diversity, and state- and nation-building.\nMy work has been published in the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, the Journal of Politics, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the American Journal of Sociology, and the European Sociological Review, amongst other outlets.\nI hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Stanford University, a J.D. from Stanford Law School, and a double B.A. in Economics and Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley. I have held prior positions at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and the European University Institute."

    "text": "Causal Inference Tutorials\nCurrently, I am offering regular tutorials (“Übungen”) in each of the three Political Science modules, with a focus on experiments and causal inference.\nThese courses will teach students how to analyze questions from their subfiled of interest through the application of causal inference methods.\nWe will begin by asking what it means for X to cause Y using the framework of potential outcomes. We will then look at some of the most popular research designs in causal analysis including experiments, regression discontinuity designs, difference-in-differences / two-way fixed effects, and instrumental variables.\nStudents will learn to apply these methods to real data in R.\nThe overarching goal is to provide students with the foundation to perform their own analyses (e.g. for their BA theses) by transferring the acquired skills to their research interests.\nYou may find the link to each of the tutorials here:\nPolitical Sociology,   International Relations,   Comparative Politics\n\n\n\nBA Thesis Colloquium in International Relations\nThis course involves support for writing a BA thesis in political science.\nStudents will need to design and carry a research strategy that includes (i) identifying an original contribution to a body of literature, (ii) finding or generating appropriate data, and (iii) conducting a rigorous data analysis.\nThis colloquium is designed to help students progress along each of these steps by providing periodic feedback from the instructor."
